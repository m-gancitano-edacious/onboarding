# onboarding
I received a version of this list from a friend who joined as a VP in the Product organization at a previous job and have subsequently expanded on it. My reaction was "who the hell is this guy asking so many questions?", so if that's **your** reaction, I get it! 

There are a few goals with these questions:
1. Build initial knowledge about the business and organization.
2. Learn how Engineering works and interacts with the other parts of the organization.
3. Inform where to ask more questions.

PRs welcome if there are other topics of interest.

# Development

## Planning and Tracking
**- How do we know if a project is on track or not?**
**- Is there any cadence for the regular review of project status with stakeholders?**

## Developer Ergonomics
**- How hard is it to setup a development environment for any particular service? Is the information available to enable anybody to do this successfully and quickly?**
**- How easy is it to get work done from the perspective of an engineer on a team?**
**- Are there any areas where we need to address tech debt?**

## Architectural and Technology Standards
**- Do we have well-defined architectural design patterns we expect all engineers to follow?**

## Security Readiness
**- Do we have standards or guidelines for how to architect secure applications?**
**- Do we do automated vulnerability testing during CI? Static analysis? Dynamic analysis? Open source vulnerabilities? Sonarqube?**
**- Do we do external penetration testing? When was the last test? What were the findings? Is the next test scheduled?**
**- Are we maintianing and/or pursuing compliance with security standards such is ISO 27k, SOC II, GDPR, FedRAMP, etc?**

## Continuous Integration
**- Is all our code always able to build successfully? What is the behavior when a commit fails the build/jobs in the CI?**

## Testing & Quality
**- How much of our testing is manual vs. automated today?**
**- Do we collect test data in any consistent and transparent way? Coverage, success rates, etc.? Where?**
**- Do we consistently test our APIs against their contracts? Is this automated? Do we use any kind of mocking or service virtualization today to enable component testing of APIs?**

## Release & Deployment
**- Do we have any consistent enforcement of what constitutes “done” for making release decisions in terms of quality, security, testing, etc.?**

## Business Velocity
**- Do we currently measure how many releases or config changes we do that result in a change to customer experience? How often do we push changes to our customers?**

## Data-driven Behavior
**- How does customer satisfaction feed back into company/product priorities?**

## Bug Management
**- How are most production bugs discovered?**
**- Do we add tests every time we fix a bug to ensure it doesn’t repeat? How universal is this behavior?**

# Platform Maturity

## Platform Portfolio
**- Have we aligned our people and teams to align to the business domain boundaries?**

# People

## Career Management
**- Is there a defined career framework? If not, why? If yes, what are the levels and expectations? Do managers and ICs have access to the expectations? Are they regularly used in career conversations?**

# Business

## Strategy and Execution
**- What are the current goals/targets/OKRs of the business?**
**- What is the process/cadence for setting/reviewing targets?**
